# Data Analytics with Azure Synapse 

### Overall Estimated Duration : **60 Minutes**

## Overview

Azure Synapse Analytics is a comprehensive analytics service that integrates big data and data warehousing into a unified platform. By utilizing Azure Synapse, organizations can efficiently query and analyze both structured and unstructured data, connect to external data sources, and perform advanced data transformations. This integrated platform empowers businesses to derive valuable insights from diverse data sets, leading to enhanced decision-making and improved operational performance.

In this hands-on lab, you will explore how to provision an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace, manage and query data from various sources, and visualize and transform data for deeper insights. You will gain the skills necessary to interact with both internal and external data, optimize data workflows, and apply transformation logic to generate actionable outcomes that support business objectives.

## Objective

Learn to leverage Azure Synapse Analytics and its serverless SQL pool to query and transform data efficiently, gaining insights and optimizing workflows. This experience will guide you through the process of provisioning a Synapse workspace, querying various file formats, and applying transformation logic to streamline data processing.

**Query Files Using a Serverless SQL Pool**: Learn how to provision an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace and query data from files stored in the data lake using serverless SQL pools. You will explore querying different file formats, including CSV, Parquet, and JSON, to efficiently access and analyze data. Additionally, you will work with external data sources in a database and visualize the results to gain actionable insights.

**Transform Files Using a Serverless SQL Pool**: Learn how to transform data using serverless SQL pools by applying CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE AS SELECT (CETAS) statements to process and store transformed data. You will also encapsulate data transformations into stored procedures to automate and optimize your workflows. This will help streamline data processing and improve the efficiency of your data management tasks.
